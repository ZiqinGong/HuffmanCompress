# Compress and Uncompress Files with Huffman Code

A simple Python program, just for fun.

## Usage

To compress(encode) a file:

```
$ python main.py -e path_to_file
```
or
```
$ python main.py --encode path_to_file
```

To uncompress(decode) a file, use the option `-d` or `--decode`.

You can also read this guidance using the option `-h` or `--help`.

## Support File Types

Not so many of them, maybe just text files like `*.txt`, `*.py`, `*.md` etc.
